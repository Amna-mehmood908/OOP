# OOP

## Overview OF MY PROJECT
The Airlines Flight Management System is a console-based C++ application designed to help users book flights, manage customer details, and generate flight tickets. The system follows a menu-driven approach, allowing users to navigate different functionalities efficiently.

This project showcases Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles in C++ by utilizing classes, objects, encapsulation, file handling, and static data members to store and retrieve information.
